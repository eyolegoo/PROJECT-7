DEVOPS TOOLING WEBSITE SOLUTION


## DEVOPS TOOLING WEBSITE SOLUTION


- In previous [Project 6](https://www.darey.io/docs/project-6-step-1/) I implemented a WordPress based solution that was filled with content and can be used as a full fledged website or blog. Moving further I added some more value to my solutions that my DevOps team could utilize. I want to introduce a set of DevOps tools that will help our team in day to day activities in managing, developing, testing, deploying and monitoring different projects.

- The tools I want our team to be able to use are well known and widely used by multiple DevOps teams, so I will introduce a single DevOps Tooling Solution that will consist of:

- 1 [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io) - free and open source automation server used to build [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) pipelines.

- 2 [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) – an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer.

- 3 [Jfrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) – Universal Repository Manager supporting all major packaging formats, build tools and CI servers. Artifactory.

- 4 [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/products/rancher) – an open source software platform that enables organizations to run and manage [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) and Kubernetes in production.

- 5 [Grafana](https://grafana.com) – a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application.
