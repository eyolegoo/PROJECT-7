# PROJECT-7
DEVOPS TOOLING WEBSITE SOLUTION


## DEVOPS TOOLING WEBSITE SOLUTION


- In previous [Project 6](https://www.darey.io/docs/project-6-step-1/) I implemented a WordPress based solution that was filled with content and can be used as a full fledged website or blog. Moving further I added some more value to my solutions that my DevOps team could utilize. I want to introduce a set of DevOps tools that will help our team in day to day activities in managing, developing, testing, deploying and monitoring different projects.

- The tools I want our team to be able to use are well known and widely used by multiple DevOps teams, so I will introduce a single DevOps Tooling Solution that will consist of:

- 1 [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io) - free and open source automation server used to build [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) pipelines.

- 2 [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) – an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer.

- 3 [Jfrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) – Universal Repository Manager supporting all major packaging formats, build tools and CI servers. Artifactory.

- 4 [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/products/rancher) – an open source software platform that enables organizations to run and manage [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) and Kubernetes in production.

- 5 [Grafana](https://grafana.com) – a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application.

- 6 [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) – An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.

- 7 [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/) – Kibana is a free and open user interface that lets you visualize your Elasticsearch [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) data and navigate the [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/) Stack.


**Side Self Study**

- Read about [Network-attached storage (NAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage), [Storage Area Network (SAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_area_network) and related protocols like NFS, (s)FTP, SMB, iSCSI. Explore what [Block-level storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block-level_storage) is and how it is used by Cloud Service providers, know the difference from Object storage.
On the example of AWS services understand the difference between Block Storage, Object Storage and Network File System.
